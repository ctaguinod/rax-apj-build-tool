# Developer Guide

## Synopsis

A command line utility tool to perform various automation tasks by APJ Build Engineering Team.

The tool was developed using [Go](https://golang.org/) with the following libraries:
- [excelize](https://github.com/360EntSecGroup-Skylar/excelize) - Golang library for reading and writing Microsoft Excelâ„¢ (XLSX) files.
- [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) - Cobra is both a library for creating powerful modern CLI applications as well as a program to generate applications and command files.
- [aws-sdk-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/) - Official AWS SDK for the Go programming language. ([official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/index.html) and [sample codes](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/go/example_code)).

## Module Installation

```bash
go get github.com/360EntSecGroup-Skylar/excelize # Install excelize module
go get github.com/spf13/cobra                    # Install cobra module
go get github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra              # Install cobra CLI tool
go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws             # Install aws sdk
```

## Commands

### Validate

The [`./rax-apj-build-tool validate`](../cmd/validate.go) command Validates DD Spreadsheet if all required fields are not empty.

[`validate`](../cmd/validate.go) uses [excelize](https://github.com/360EntSecGroup-Skylar/excelize) to Read Input DD Spreadsheet and Output Validated Spreadsheet.

Functions:

- `copy` - Used to copy input file spreadsheet to validated spreadsheet.
- `ScanKeys` and `ScanBorders` - Used to scan the input spreadsheet file, sheet and search for the resource name using regex and will output the cell ranges to be used and processed by `validateCellsIfNotEmpty`.
- `validateCellsIfNotEmpty` - Used to validate cells if empty, non empty cells will highlight the cell to color GREEN and empty cell will highlight the color to ORANGE meaning needs to be filled in.

Flags:

- `-i` - Input File needs to be .xlsx spreadsheet.
- `--sheets` - The sheets to process.
- `--resources` - The resources (Keys) to process.

### QC

The [`./rax-apj-build-tool qc`](../cmd/qc.go) command runs an automated QC of AWS Environment using the validated DD spreadsheet.

[`qc`](../cmd/qc.go) uses [excelize](https://github.com/360EntSecGroup-Skylar/excelize) to Read Input DD Spreadsheet and Outputs result if PASS or FAIL in CLI.

Functions:

- `ScanKeys` and `ScanBorders` - Used to scan the input spreadsheet file, sheet and search for the resource name using regex and will output the cell ranges to be used and processed by `getResourcesMap`.
- `getResourcesMap` - Used to scan the cell values and outputs it nested map to be used to query the AWS environment if the resource exists.
- `getVpc` - Query the AWS environment for the VPC based on the DD Spreadsheet.
- `getSubnets` - Query the AWS environment for the Subnets based on the DD Spreadsheet.
- `getEC2` - Query the AWS environment for the EC2 instances based on the DD Spreadsheet.

Flags:

- `-i` - Input File needs to be .xlsx spreadsheet.
- `--sheets` - The sheets to process.
- `--resources` - The resources (Keys) to process.
